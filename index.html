        <p class="lead-text">I architect and build systems that scale. Full company lifecycle—from early technical decisions through migration, product-market fit, and enterprise scale. Architecture that delivers real business impact.</p>

        <p>Led full organizational migrations to Azure Government Cloud, architected centralized data platforms, and built custom solutions that deliver measurable value—including a Salesforce component that generated $2.5M in annual cost savings. Technical decisions have consequences. Architecture choices compound over time. I design systems with scale, sustainability, and operational reality in mind.</p>

          <div class="expertise-item">
            <h3 class="expertise-title">Technical Execution</h3>
            <p>Write code, design APIs, build infrastructure. Python, JavaScript, cloud-native architectures. CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, automation workflows. Code is a means to an end—systems that solve real problems and scale reliably.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="expertise-item">
            <h3 class="expertise-title">Systems Architecture</h3>
            <p>Design systems that work at scale. Cloud migrations, data platforms, microservices, infrastructure-as-code. Built fault-tolerant architectures using Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes. Architecture decisions consider technical requirements, operational complexity, cost, and long-term maintainability.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Stay current with technology, but more interested in how systems work in production—where they break, how they scale, what decisions compound over time. Focus on real market fit over vanity metrics. Build systems that evolve as requirements change.</p>

        <p class="cta-text">Building something that needs to scale, or migrating systems that need to work reliably? I work with founders, CTOs, and technical leaders who understand that architecture decisions have long-term consequences.</p>

            <li>Architected a centralized Azure data platform integrating Salesforce CRM, Accounting Seed, and AvSight ERP. The architectural decision: one source of truth rather than siloed systems. Result: improved data availability and cross-functional reporting that enabled better business decisions.</li>
            <li>Built a <strong>custom Salesforce Lightning Web Component</strong> for parts research. The product decision: build custom rather than use existing tools. The outcome: <strong>$2.5M in annual cost savings</strong> through reduced labor time, eliminated procurement errors, and minimized operational delays.</li>
            <li>Developed automated ETL pipelines that eliminated manual data handling. The infrastructure decision: automate data flows rather than maintain manual processes. Impact: improved data consistency across sales, operations, and finance teams.</li>
            <li>Implemented cloud security, governance, and access controls aligned with government infrastructure standards. The security decision: build compliance into the architecture from the start, not as an afterthought.</li>
            <li>Optimized Azure infrastructure for scalability, performance, and cost efficiency. The operational decision: optimize for long-term cost and performance, not just initial deployment.</li>
            <li>Led technical teams and established best practices. The leadership decision: set standards early, mentor consistently, and build systems that others can maintain and extend.</li>

The challenge wasn't just technical migration, but ensuring zero downtime, maintaining data integrity, and meeting government compliance requirements. I architected a centralized data platform that integrated three systems (Salesforce CRM, Accounting Seed, AvSight ERP) into a single source of truth. This is migration done right: planned, executed, and optimized for long-term operations.</p>
