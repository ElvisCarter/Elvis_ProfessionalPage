        <p class="lead-text">I architect and build systems that scale. Full company lifecycle—from early technical decisions through migration, product-market fit, and enterprise scale. Architecture that delivers real business impact.</p>

        <p>Led full organizational migrations to Azure Government Cloud, architected centralized data platforms, and built custom solutions that deliver measurable value—including a Salesforce component that generated $2.5M in annual cost savings. Technical decisions have consequences. Architecture choices compound over time. I design systems with scale, sustainability, and operational reality in mind.</p>

            <p>Write code, design APIs, build infrastructure. Python, JavaScript, cloud-native architectures. CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, automation workflows. Code is a means to an end—systems that solve real problems and scale reliably.</p>

          <div class="expertise-item">
            <h3 class="expertise-title">Systems Architecture</h3>
            <p>Design systems that work at scale. Cloud migrations, data platforms, microservices, infrastructure-as-code. Built fault-tolerant architectures using Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes. Architecture decisions consider technical requirements, operational complexity, cost, and long-term maintainability.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Stay current with technology, but more interested in how systems work in production—where they break, how they scale, what decisions compound over time. Focus on real market fit over vanity metrics. Build systems that evolve as requirements change.</p>

        <p class="cta-text">Building something that needs to scale, or migrating systems that need to work reliably? I work with founders, CTOs, and technical leaders who understand that architecture decisions have long-term consequences.</p>
